                        Bears are extraordinarily intelligent animals.
                        Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing.
                        Some species of Asiatic bear build nests in the trees.

                    <p>
                        Their feet work like salad tongs. ...
                        Almost half of all known species live in madagascar. ...
                        Chameleons vary wildly in terms of size. ...
                        They mainly change color in order to communicate or regulate body temperature. ...
                        Skin crystals enable them to change color at will.

                    <p>
                        They have great camouflage for their environment.
                        Their eyes are different to normal bears.
                        They spend a lot of their day eating.
                        Bamboo is critical to their diet.
                        But they do occasionally eat something other than bamboo.

                        Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
                        Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.
                        When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.
                        Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!

                        Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.
                        Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities.
                        Pigeons are highly sociable animals.
                        Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.

                    <p>
                        Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs.
                        The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus.
                        They're true bugs (from the order Hemiptera).
                        Most have red-orange eyes.
                        Females may be attracted to the sound of motors.
